# What is StuffApp?

Stuffapp is an web-based application to manage stuff. 

* Create lists of items that are relevant to you
* Add photos, descriptions etc.
* Organize your items

# Why StuffApp? 

I have a lot of stuff at home which I do not use very often. However, I don't want to throw good things away. 
Unfortunately, I do not even know all the stuff that I have, and where. Sometimes, I buy something just because I cannot find the thing any more. 

For me, it would be best if I can : 
1. sell unused / unnecessary items easily
2. lend unused stuff (that I don't want to sell) to others (friends, family)
3. get rid of stuff I actually don't need any more

## Steps to get the application up and running: 

The app is developed based on Ruby on Rails V6.0.1.
